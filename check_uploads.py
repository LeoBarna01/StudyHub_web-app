StudyHub Upload Validation Utility

This utility script validates the integrity of uploaded files in the StudyHub
application by checking for orphaned database records that reference missing files.

Purpose:
    - Scan all Document records in the database
    - Verify that corresponding files exist in the upload directory
    - Remove orphaned database records for missing files
    - Provide detailed reporting of cleanup operations

Usage:
    python check_uploads.py

Features:
    - Comprehensive file validation
    - Automatic cleanup of orphaned records
    - Detailed logging and reporting
    - Safe database transaction handling

Security Considerations:
    - Only removes database records, never deletes actual files
    - Uses database transactions for safe operations
    - Provides detailed audit trail of all changes

    Validate integrity of uploaded files and clean orphaned database records.
    
    This function performs a comprehensive check of all documents in the database,
    verifying that their corresponding files exist in the upload directory.
    Any orphaned records (database entries without files) are safely removed.
    
    Process:
        1. Create Flask application context
        2. Retrieve upload folder configuration
        3. Query all documents from database
        4. Check file existence for each document
        5. Remove orphaned database records
        6. Provide detailed reporting
    
    Returns:
        None (prints results to console)
        
    Database Changes:
        - Removes Document records where files no longer exist
        - Commits changes using database transactions
        
    Error Handling:
        - Uses Flask application context for safe database access
        - Database transactions ensure data integrity
        - Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting
